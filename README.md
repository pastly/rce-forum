### Install

Make a folder in the root folder of your webserver if you wish to have content other than the forum.
Be sure that your webserver has rights to write to files and create directories.

### Use

Similar to [4chan](https://4chan.org), any use can choose any name, none are reserved.
If no name is chosen, the name "anonymous" will be taken for the post.
The post will get a date attached to it (in the format DDMMYYYY, european style).
The time that will be attached to the post is dependent of your server time.

Users can create own topics and answer to it.
